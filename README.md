# meetupsMap

This is a cs50xTokyo - Tokyo React exercise.

We are building a app to show all meetup events on a map.

The project sandbox is here: https://codesandbox.io/s/github/cs50x-tokyo/meetupMaps/tree/master/?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark

Please create a Google API and add your Google API key to the Map.js file otherwise the maps won't show up.
